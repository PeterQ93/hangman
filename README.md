# **Hangman Game**
<hr>

## **Introduction**
<hr>
Hangman is a classic game played all over the world. The aim is to guess the word in 3-6 tries. If the user guesses the word before they run out of wrong tries, they win the game. If the user does not guess the word then its game over. The user can choose which diffiulty they want to play with a range from 3 to 6 guesses.The user is then asked if they would like to play again. With every failed guess more and more features of a stick figure would appear on the gallows until it is complete.

## **Features**

<hr>

### **Main Menu**

![Main Menu](assets/images/welcome.png)

This Main Menu is the first thing the user sees. It gives them two options if they are unfamiliar with the game they can read the rules, Or if they know how to play they can proceed and play. I added a bit of colour to the two options so they would stand out. Above the two options displays the name of the game and the final stage of the hangman.

### **Rules**

After the main menu, if the player selects the option to read the rules this is what will come up on the terminal. A numbered set of rules starting at 1 and ending at 7. If the player hits the Enter key it will then bring them back to the main menu.
