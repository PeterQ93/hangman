# **Hangman Game**
<hr>

## **Introduction**
<hr>
Hangman is a classic game played all over the world. The aim is to guess the word in 3-6 tries. If the user guesses the word before they run out of wrong tries, they win the game. If the user does not guess the word then its game over. The user can choose which diffiulty they want to play with a range from 3 to 6 guesses.The user is then asked if they would like to play again. With every failed guess more and more features of a stick figure would appear on the gallows until it is complete.

## **Features**

<hr>

### **Main Menu**

![Main Menu](assets/images/welcome.png)

This Main Menu is the first thing the user sees. It gives them two options if they are unfamiliar with the game they can read the rules, Or if they know how to play they can proceed and play. I added a bit of colour to the two options so they would stand out. Above the two options displays the name of the game and the final stage of the hangman.

### **Rules**

![Game Rules](assets/images/rules.png)

After the main menu, if the player selects the option to read the rules this is what will come up on the terminal. A numbered set of rules starting at 1 and ending at 7. If the player hits the Enter key it will then bring them back to the main menu.

### **Difficulty**

![Game Difficulty](assets/images/difficulty.png)

Once you pick option 1 to play the game you get to choose the difficulty you want to pick.
There are 3 options Easy, Medium and Hard. Easy gives you 8 chances, Medium gives you 6 chances and Hard gives you 4 chances.

### **Game Started**

![Game Start](assets/images/game_start.png)

Once the game starts the position the user starts in becomes visible. The user can see which difficulty they picked and how many lives they have. They then can see how long the word they have to guess is and it will tell the user what guesses they have already picked. If the user gets a letter wrong the hanging will begin.

### **Wrong Input**

![Wrong Letter](assets/images/game_wrong_let.png)

![Wrong Character](assets/images/game_wrong_char.png)

- If the user puts in the the wrong letter it will give them a message at the top of the terminal telling them that is not the letter there looking for.
- If the user trys to put in two letters it will provide a message at the top of the terminal explaining to only use one letter at a time.
- If the user puts in any character other than a letter it will give them a message telling them they can only provide letters.
